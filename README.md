# Cryptography in Python

### Project 1

* `AES_code.py` uses AES encryption to create a shared key

### Project 2

* `RSA_code.py` uses RSA Encryption to generate public and private key pairs for users and saves them

### Project 3

* `RSA_code.py` uses RSA Encryption now creates a Digital Signature, attaches it to a message, and also creates timestamps that are used to prevent replay attacks
